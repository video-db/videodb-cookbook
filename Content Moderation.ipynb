    "`VideoDB`gives you power to choose any bits from any video in an instant. If you are streaming a content that has unwanted section for minors and NSFW content, you can easily skip that by just identifying the timeline where unwanted content exists and videoDB would take care of your stream to skip those secions.

    "2. We've identified specific times when inappropriate video content appears. This was achieved using AWS Rekognition API. If you're curious about the full process, including how to find visual inappropriate content in a video, check out our [blog](https://docs.videodb.io/aws-rekognition-and-videodb-effortlessly-remove-inappropriate-co-6) where we walk through the entire process.\n",
    "3. In this blog post, however, we're going to skip the details of AWS Rekognition APIs and jump straight to the timestamps.\n",
    "4. We've analyzed the appearances of visually inappropriate content, and then relatively computed the section of video which are safe.\n",
    "5. Next, we'll upload the video to VideoDb and generate a safe stream ⚡️!"
