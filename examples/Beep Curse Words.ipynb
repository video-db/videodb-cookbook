Yeah people think I was joking about that. Let me show you how to do that. Watch this box. Here we go. What is the definition? What's the definition of mother? Come on, you piece of shit. Play 2 Chainz. I'm sorry about that. What's the definition of mother? She has given birth. Do you want to hear the next one? Yes. it means child Yes. What's a verb that means give birth to? Oh my God, Siri, bitch, you took it from me and moved it and then take it out. Do they take out the dead body one. Remember the first one that's a crazy one short for motherfuker. It would say as a no. Think I tweeted what it said what exactly it said. Yeah, I did it. I did it today you did and it took me a couple tries cuz I didn't say it, right. But I ended up doing it. Did it says as a noun short for motherfuker, but it could be a verb as well. Right. Yeah, if you're actually a mother fucker ass here with mother means that gives you the correct definition then asked you do you want to the next one you say? Yes, it says as a noun it means short for motherfuker. Yeah, I got it. Right but it was weird to hear like I heard it. I was like what that's real like a mash-up that's like your mom and she's like teaching a little kid how to use Siri like Mommy. How do I know where Mommy is? Well, we can ask Siri sweetie. We can ask Siri what mother means Do you want to hear the next 10K as a noun short from mother? A little kid like what did they say? Is Santa real? I'm going to pretend you didn't ask that I don't want you to get a lump of coal this year. Alexa tells you and uses the shares a needle. Siri are you allowed to swear? I just want to know if you stopped using curse words recently. I'm not sure I understand. Well earlier in this week. I had asked you what mother means and you gave me one definition then you had you said do you? The next one and you said as of now and it made short for motherfuker, I just thought that was weird. Siri you sound like a crazy person. I've been trying to talk to you about this issue that you and I are having about communication. And what do you say to me? You say that's not nice. What's not nice for you to say motherfuker in front of that little three-year-old. Just learn how to talk. Well, this is the future. This is the future. We're going to be having arguments with our our digital devices like that. That's a crude like helper. I get super crude helper, right like what Siri can do now? It's very crude. But this is just like the iPhone one right? Maybe I can keep up the conversation for sure that's going to\""
